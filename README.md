# EDA_Credit_Risk_Analysis
This case study provides a comprehensive overview of the practical application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the context of risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector.   The main focus of the study is to demonstrate how data analysis can effectively mitigate the risks associated with lending decisions while optimizing business outcomes.

The case study begins by addressing the challenges faced by loan providing companies in extending credit due to insufficient credit histories of applicants, which can result in defaults. The scenario revolves around a consumer finance company specializing in urban loans, where EDA is employed to discern data patterns. The primary goal is to ensure that loan applicants with the ability to repay aren't unfairly rejected.

The key business objectives are clearly outlined, emphasizing the identification of patterns indicating potential payment difficulties. By harnessing these patterns, the company aims to make informed decisions such as adjusting loan amounts, higher interest rates for risky applicants, or loan denial. The overarching objective is to reduce defaults and losses by targeting consumers who are more likely to repay.

The dataset at the core of the study consists of three files. 'application_data.csv' contains client information at the application stage, including payment difficulties. 'previous_application.csv' provides insights into clients' historical loan data, indicating whether previous applications were approved, cancelled, refused, or unused. 'columns_description.csv' serves as a data dictionary, clarifying variable meanings.

Through the course of the case study, the company aims to uncover driving factors behind loan defaults and identify strong indicators of default through EDA. By gaining insights into these variables, the company can enhance its risk assessment strategies and portfolio management, ultimately improving lending decisions.

In summary, this case study delves into the practical application of EDA in the context of risk analytics within the financial sector. By analyzing client data and historical loan information, the study aims to identify factors influencing loan defaults and equip the company with actionable insights to optimize lending practices and mitigate risks effectively.
